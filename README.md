This is the custom firmware created in the 32 hour Software Hackathon with the constraints given by the juries, So it doesn't meant to a completely working firmware. Use this firmware only when you know what you are working with or what you are editing. This firmware is developed for Arduino Mega control board with the A4988 stepper driver with the 3 stepper motors for X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis. This also includes the conditions for Extruder parameters like extruding temperature monitoring and controlling and also fans as a cooling the circuits.
